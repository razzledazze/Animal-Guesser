A text based program to determine the animal which the user is trying to find
The csv file is in the format "Line number","Question","Line number for yes answer","Line number for no answer"
If yes is answered to a question, the question on the line stated under "Line number for yes answer" will be asked next. The same for a no answer. If the line number fo rthe next question is not a number, it is a final answer, and the end of that pathway has been reached. The line number, which is actually an animal, will be printed, and the program will end.
